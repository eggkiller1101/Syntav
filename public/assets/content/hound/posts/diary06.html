      Late night coding sessions have a different energy. The world is quiet,
      distractions are minimal, and there's a sense of being in a bubble with
      just the code and your thoughts.
    </p>

      Sometimes the best solutions come when you're working in these quiet
      hours, when the logical mind can fully engage without the noise of daily
      life.
